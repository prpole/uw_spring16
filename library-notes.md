#Zotero (Phil) - 15 minutes (not more than 20)

Intro: what is zotero and why is it good? In what ways does it save you labor?

    - Drag and drop sources like playlists in a music library; useful if you
        work in one field a lot like I do
    - Avoid messy syntax; export to clipboard or citation management file

Demo adding sources to zotero: use demo topic (Comparing the view of Robert
Moses and Jane Jacobs in contemporary urban design for my class; for Buck's?)

    - Use 2 articles, 1 magazine article, 2 books (or something)
    - Use at least one CLIO source to show that the data is all messy; demo
        cleaning data
    - Use at least one JSTOR source to show that some databases start out with
        considerably cleaner data
    - If you already have a book you can just search for it on Amazon, CLIO, or
        Google Books; just make sure you have the right edition so the page
        numbers are right

EXERCISE: Now, pull up the list of sources you have right now. Using some
combination of CLIO, JSTOR, Amazon, Google etc., find those files online and
import them into Zotero. We'll be floating around to help.

    - Essential search tools video (display, say they can view at home)

## Categories of Databases
* Background Sources:

## BEAM Categories of Sources
* What kind of sources are you still needing? Background, Exhibit (evidence, example), Argumentative, Method?
* Barring this, do you need a book? Scholarly article? Newspaper/magazine article (background/evidence-example)


* Demo searches, books:
    - Brain perception time near-death (google books)
    - gentrification and colonialism (amazon)
* Demo, Articles:
    - 

each student uses one and jots down a few sentences about how it works and what
kind of sources; for homework

- How to limit the vast number of sources?

# Finding a book - 20 minutes [Buck]

* You should have several titles already on your source list, and hopefully found some titles through the database exploration we just did.
* Identify one *book* on your source list. [Factor into the above exercise: as they are searching databases, look in bibliographies/works cited, etc., to identify one book they want to look at.] Head into clio, and see if it is in Butler Library. 
* Write down call number/send it to phone(!). Go into stacks, find the book.
* Once you've located the book, look at the other books in the area. On the same shelf, the shelves above and below, etc. Spend a minute or two browsing titles.
* Choose one book, in addition to the one you went there to find, to check out. 
* Bring back both to classroom. Be back no later than 12:50 / 2:20. Discuss the process.


Use the catalog search and factioning to find a book that will be useful to
your research.

look around the stacks for related titles, write down x number of titles; come
back
